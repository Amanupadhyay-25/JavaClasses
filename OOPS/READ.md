Animal: Here i create a Program using methods object and class .

....................# Object Initialization (there are three ways to initialized object...........................

1.Using reference Variable
example : Animal1: This is the program of initializing object using refernce variable.
2.By using method 
example : Animal2: This is the program of initializing object using method.
3.Using Constructor.......................
...........................................................................................................................................................................................
There are three types of # Constructor
* Need of Constructor :- Whenever we create a object using new keyword so new memory space is allocated and if there are n number of object then the memory spaced is so large so to reduce the memory spaced we need constructor and befault it assign 0 to the integer if we dont assign any value as in case of default constructor.
1.Default constructor : make by the compiler 
2.NonParameterized Constructor : Make by the user itself.
3.Parameterized Constructor : Can take aregument and then assign it into the consturctor .
# NOTE 
1.Constructor have same name as the class
2.Constructor does not have return type because it is used to initialized value to the object.
3. Constructor does not declared as final or static . It is only private ,Protected,private,default.
